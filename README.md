<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/e0e44f005da5c3bdd6d4377fee764552.png)

This project was created my senior year at Naperville Central High School for my Game Design class. I was in a team of four people where I lead the team and did all the programming and Unity creation. The three other members of the team worked on artwork, music, and a story for the game.

### Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To play the game run `2D Platformer Game.exe` in the 2D Platformer Game folder. You use W and D to move left and right and press W to jump. While playing a level you can press ESC to pause/resume the game. There are powerups that you can pickup around the map that can provide you with temporary infinite ammo, a shield, or one more bullet. Defeat the enemies and reach the flag at the end of the level to complete it.

### Prerequisites

You must be on Windows 10 or MacOS to play the game.

### Installation

For editing:
1. Download the repository
2. Open up Unity and add the project by selecting the folder that you downloaded.
3. Edit or add onto our game!

For playing:
1. Download the repository
2. Run `2D Platformer Game.exe`


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project could be used for someone who wants to try to build a similar game or add on levels to our current game.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Known issues:
- Crouch animations plays when hitting head on ceiling.
- In rare cases the player can get stuck on side of walls.

Future additions:
- More levels
- Keep track of how fast a level is beaten
